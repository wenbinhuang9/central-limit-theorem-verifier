## Central Limit Theorem
This is a presentation of central limit theorem from coding.

Compute the average distribution of uniform distribution, binomial distribution, normal distribution,
and poisson distribution.

No matter what distribution is, its average distribution is always normal.


## Avg distribution of uniform distribution
[avg of uniform distribution!]()
